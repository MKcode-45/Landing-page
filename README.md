# Landing-page

Overview:
This project involves styling and laying out a landing page. By completing this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS, particularly the use of CSS Flexbox.

Review:
I have completed this project to the best of my ability and learned how to use Flexbox effectively. The most challenging part was figuring out why the header wasn't centered, even after setting justify-content to center. After some research, I found information on Stack Overflow indicating that using flex-grow can affect the behavior of justify-content. I now feel more confident in using flex-box to create web page layouts.
